# tictactoe

A classic game, this version of tic-tac-toe was developed from a Python code project I did which only uses Jupyter Notebook. From there,
I created TKInter interface so that anybody can use it.

Right now, the game can be played between a user and a computer, who randomly selects on the board. My intention is to integrate my 
knowledge on Machine Learning - Reinforcement Learning into the code to make the responses smarter and make the game more challenging.

This is an ongoing project. The interface may change, and this **README** will be updated as needed.

## Documentation

There are several buttons on this application:

**Train** - This button will train the machine to make it smarter and make the game more challenging. This is currently unavailable,
but there should be no problem since data can be manufactured for this game.

**Reset** - This button will reset the game at any point.

**Exit** - This button will end the game and exit the module.

## Installation
